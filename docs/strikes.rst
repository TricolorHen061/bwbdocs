Strikes
=======

This article will explain what strikes are, and how to manage them.

What are strikes?
-----------------

.. note::
    Strikes only work if you have at least one limit created.

When a person gets their message blocked, they will get a "strike". It's just a way to keep track of how many times they got their messages deleted.

Viewing and managing strikes
----------------------------

To see how many strikes a person has, run ``/strikes``. The bot will send an embed containing their strikes. If you're a moderator, you can press the ``Edit`` button to change their strikes.
