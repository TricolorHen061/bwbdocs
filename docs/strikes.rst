Strikes
=======

This article will explain what strikes are, and how to manage them.

What are strikes?
-----------------

.. note::
    Strikes only work if you have at least one limit created.

When a person gets their message blocked, they will get a "strike". It's simply a way to keep track of how many times they got their messages deleted. They are useful for "limits", which are explained on the next page.

Viewing and managing strikes
----------------------------

To see how many strikes a person has, run ``/strikes view``. If you're a moderator, you can use ``/strikes edit`` to edit their strikes.
