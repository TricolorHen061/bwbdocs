Terms of Service
================

``Short version:`` Use common sense. Don't abuse or copy the bot. Thanks.

``Long version``:

Don't do any of the following

- Any form of abusing. This includes, but is not limited to, spamming blacklisted words to abuse the bot, using the bot for any illegal activites, and exploiting the bot's features. (PS: If you find an exploit, please report it)
- Copying features. Please, do not blatantly copy features of off Bad Word Blocker. Obviously, you can implement very similar features into your bot, but don't make an exact copy.

If you break any of those rules, you'll be banned from using the bot.
