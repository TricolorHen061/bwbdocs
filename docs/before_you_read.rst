===============
- Throughout the documentation, you will hear about ``commands``. A ``command`` refers to a Slash Command, which is a command that can be invoked by typing a ``/`` followed by the command name and parameters.
- All commands that involve administrative actions are locked to moderators. It wouldn't be very nice if anyone could run commands and change settings, would it?.
