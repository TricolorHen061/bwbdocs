Before you read
===============
- Throughout the documentation, you will hear about ``commands``. A ``command`` refers to a Slash Command, which is a command that can be invoked by typing a ``/`` followed by the command name and parameters.
- All commands that involve managing or moderating are locked to moderators to avoid regular members from tampering with them. If a regular person attempts to run one of these commands, they will be met with a ``Missing Permissions`` error message, telling them what required permission(s) they lack.
