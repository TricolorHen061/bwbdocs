Before you read
===============
- Throughout the documentation, you will hear about ``commands``. A ``command`` refers to a Slash Command, which is a command that can be invoked by typing a ``/`` followed by the command name and parameters.
- Most commands that involve administrative actions are locked to moderators, of course. It wouldn't be nice if anyone could run commands and change settings.
- Unlike some other bots, Bad Word Blocker is free. Everything is free. It was designed to be a valid alternative to other bots so that you would not have to pay.
