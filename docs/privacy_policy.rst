Bad Word Blocker collects data needed to deliver features. It collects:

- **User IDs**: Used to identify your account and to store strikes, and your deleted messages.
- **Guild IDs**: Used to identify your server and to store blacklists, limits, etc
- **Channel IDs**: Used to identify channels, so the bot knows where to send logs (if you set it up)
- **Role IDs**: Used to identify roles, in case you want a role to bypass the bot's filter
- **Messages**: Bad Word Blocker will **ONLY** store a message if it gets deleted, in case you want it back with the `/get` command. No other messages are logged.
