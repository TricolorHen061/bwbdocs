December 2021 Update
====================
You're probbably here because you saw there was an update in the bot's status. This article will list the things that got updated, and `why` I updated them.

All list commands combined
    I merged all commands that were used to modify lists- ``/badwordlist``, ``/links``, ``/badphraselit``- into one new command: ``/blacklist``. I did this because when I wanted to add another list, I realized how messy, long, and un-organized the commands where becoming. Each list typically has 3 commands: ``add``, ``remove``, ``view``, and sometimes ``clear`` and ``reset``. I added a 4th list. If I didn't do this update, that would have been about 15 commands people would have had to memorize!

New documentation
    There is new documentation for the bot. It's the website you're on right now. I made this because I saw an increasing number ofpeople getting confused on using the bot, and there was just a lack of instructions in general. Not anymore!
