December 2021 Update
====================
This is probably the biggest update this bot has ever had, not because of it's size, but because of how it fixes the bots greatest weakness: 
- How easy it was to circumvent by mispelling words
- Lack of doucmentation

Below is a list of what this update includes.

All list commands combined
    I merged all commands that were used to modify lists- ``/badwordlist``, ``/links``, ``/badphraselist``- into one new command: ``/blacklist``. This was done to lessen the amount of commands people have to remember.

Filtering system reworked
    As mentioned above, all filtering commands can now be done with ``/blacklist``. Along with this update, the names of the lists were changed:

    - "badwordlist" -> "exact-match word list"
    - "bad link list" -> "link list"
    - "bad phrase list" -> "phrase list"

    and the newest addition:

    - "in-word-match word list"

    .. ref::
        blacklisting

    You can read about how this works here.

New documentation
    There is new documentation for the bot. It's the website you're on right now. I made this because I saw an increasing number ofpeople getting confused on using the bot, and there was just a lack of instructions in general. Not anymore!
