Sometimes, you'll want certain roles or channels to bypass the bot's filter. This article will show you how to do that.

=================
Using ``/bypass``
=================

You can allow roles and channels to bypass the bot. The ``/bypass`` command has corrosponding subcommands for them:

- ``/bypass role``
- ``/bypass channel``
  
Obviously, ``/bypass role`` is for allowing a role to bypass the bot, and ``/bypass channel`` is for allowing a channel to bypass the bot. Just run them and fill out the parameters that are shown on-screen accordingly.

If you want to remove a role or channel from bypassing, use `/bypass manage`.
