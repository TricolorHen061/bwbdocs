Limits
======

This article will teach you what limits are, and how to use them.

What are limits?
----------------

Counting strikes would be useless if it were not for limits. You can use limits to put a "cap" on the amount of strikes a user can get before they get a punishment, like a timeout, kick, or ban.

Managing Limits
---------------

You can add a limit by running the ``/limits add`` command. You can delete them by running the ``/limits manage`` command.

A limit takes 2 things: A strike amount and an action. When a person reaches the strike amount, they get the action. So for exmaple, if you add a limit with an amount of ``3``, and an action of ``ban``, when a person reaches 3 strikes, they'll get banned.

You can also add an optional time limit (in minutes) if you want the action to be undone.
