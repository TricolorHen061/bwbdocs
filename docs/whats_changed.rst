What's changed?
***************

You may be here because you noticed that the bot started acting a bit weird. This is because the bot was remade from scratch, and some features were removed or changed.

What was removed
================
- Verification system
- All moderation commands (since Discord has built-in ones now)
- Suggestion command
- Settings command
- Admin bypassing. In this new version, if you want someone to bypass the bot, use ``/bypass role`` and give them the role you set
- Other small commands and features that cluttered up the bot
- The dashboard was shut down
  
What was added
==============
- A simplified blacklisting system. You can now manage the entire blacklist with ``/blacklist`` in a simple-to-use interface
- Better false-positive detecting. The older bot would often get false positives. This version is 95% better at catching them
- Less commands. I've managed to chop down the commands to 20. Much better than the 34+ the bot used to have.
