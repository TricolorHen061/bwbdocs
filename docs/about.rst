About
=====
I started my programming journey in November of 2021 out of competition. My friend at the time made a Discord bot, and I wanted to make one. I did anyway, despite barely knowing anything about programming, in the `Python <https://python.org>`_ programming language.

As soon as I made my first Discord bot, I fell in love with programming. Creating stuff was fun- even though though I didn't knew what I was doing. I begged and annoyed people for help and copied snippets of code off the internet. After a few months of doing that, I started to understand what the code meant- and what I was doing.

The feature of deleting messages if they contained a word was originally implemented in Tribuntu, my first public Discord bot, but I decided to make it it's own bot. In December 2021, I created Bad Word Blocker, not thinking it would become "popular".

As soon as it was released on `Top.gg <https://top.gg>`_, it blew up. It gained more servers in 48 hours than Tribuntu did in 3 weeks. I then created what is now the `Bad Word Blocker Community Server <https://top.gg/servers/722594194513723987/join>`_.

Fast-foward almost 2 years later, and re-written in the `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>` programming language by me, Bad Word Blocker is within the top 1,000 bots on Discord. It's in about 4,500 servers (at time of writing). It's scanned over way above 5,000,000 messages, and did something I've always wanted to do: help people.

Current Technical Information:

**Programming Language:** TypeScript

**Library:** discord.js

**Database Software:** MongoDB

Thank you for using Bad Word Blocker.
